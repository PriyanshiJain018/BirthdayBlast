   * When user clicks candle: candle flickers, then **explodes** with confetti.
   * “You blew it… literally.”

3. **Glitched Birthday Song**

   * A birthday tune starts, glitches halfway, slows down creepily.
   * Screen “shakes” using CSS animation.

   * A funny “fake” popup shows:
     *“WARNING: Too much sweetness detected. Heart overload.”*

5. **Surprise Game** (Optional)

   * User is challenged to “Tap the Cake” — but it keeps dodging their mouse. 😈

6. **Ending Screen**

## 🔐 PWA Manifest (Optional)

To make the app installable:

```json
{
  "name": "BirthdayBlast",
  "short_name": "Blast",
  "start_url": "index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "description": "A birthday prank that spirals hilariously out of control!",
  "icons": [{
    "src": "assets/cake.png",
    "sizes": "192x192",
    "type": "image/png"
  }]
}
```

And use a simple service worker to cache HTML/CSS/JS.

## 🧠 Claude Prompt Template (if you want him to generate code):

```
You are a fun and clean web developer. Based on the following app documentation, generate the full code (HTML, CSS, JS) for a static web app called "BirthdayBlast". It should be hosted via GitHub Pages, support offline mode via PWA if possible, and contain all the prank features as described. Add fun interactions and glitchy effects as per spec.

[Paste Full Doc Above]
```

If you want me to build this version now for GitHub with simple `index.html` + `script.js`, just say the word and I’ll do it here itself. 🧁💣

Ready for the *Blast*?
